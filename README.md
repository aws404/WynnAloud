## Committing
If you are committing  to the project please make sure you read the information below for that is suitable to your situation 

### Voice Lines and Code
Thank you for choosing to help with the project! Adding voice lines can be a tedious process but it will begin to become second nature in no time. Before recording please read the 'Just Voice Lines' section first.
Steps:
- Record your File
  - When recording your line please try and eliminate echoing, background noise and popping on the microphone. Some clips may be discarded if they are not of high enough quality.
  - Your clip should contain all the text in the dialog block. For instance: quest lines [1/7] - [7/7] should be the only things in a singular audio file.
  - Try to do all the lines for the one character, this includes even the ones that you may not think of like:
    - Under leveled lines
    - During quest lines
    - Finished quest lines
    - And any other dialog
  - Do any editing you may want done yourself, other people will likely not do audio editing for you.
  - Be enthusiastic and take on your character! Put yourself in the shoes of the character your are impersonating, think how they would be feeling and portray it in their voice.
- Convert the audio file to the '.ogg' file format. It is recommended to use this website to convert the file: https://convertio.co/mp3-ogg/
- Name the audio file in accordance to the rules:
  - Contains the NPCs names
  - All lowercase letters
- Place the audio file in a relavant quest/area dirrectory at 'soundpacks/current/sounds/'
- Register the sound in the 'sounds.json' file in the 'soundpacks/current' directory. Ensure to define all values and ensure all JSON is valid or it will break!
- Committing your files:
  - Commit the files and wait for a new soundpack update to be pushed.
  - If any of the steps are not done correctly then when someone adds your line it will not work correctly or will not be added at all.
